## BBEdit/TextWrangler Language Code Module for colorizing your EdgeOS config.boot files

For you Mac users with BBEdit or TextWrangler, here is a Language Code Module I created to add color to the keywords and create fold points for the config.boot stanzas.

### Instructions:

  * Make sure you quit BBEdit or TextWrangler
  * Unzip the file to: ~/Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/Language\ Modules/
  * Open BBEdit or TextWrangler
  * Check the screenshot below for tips on enabling config.boot for color and folding - it really helps with hand editing!
